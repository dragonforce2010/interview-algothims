'''
Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

Example
Given root = {1,#,2}, k = 2, return 2.

Challenge
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
